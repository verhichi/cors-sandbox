# CORS Test

## What is this?

My practice app to experiment with CORS errors. The goal is to find out the cause of CORS errors and also to find out what one can do to fix it.

## Project Overview

- Backend: [Nest.js](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
- Frontend: [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) + [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
